# Claude Code Power Pack

Advanced slash commands and workflows for Claude Code power users.

> **‚ö° Experimental Tool Collection**  
> This is an experimental personal tool collection for exploring Claude Code capabilities. 
> Use as inspiration for your own implementations. No warranties - just ideas to spark creativity!

## üöÄ Quick Example

**Want to see it in action?** Here's a real example of the `/plan_review_revise` slash command:

### What I Did
*Inside a Claude Code REPL session:*
```bash
/plan_review_revise Logging infrastructure plan, using simplicity and comprehensive perspectives. Think very hard about these.
```

### How It Worked
1. **Prerequisites**: The [`logging-infrastructure-plan-v1.md`](plans/logging-infrastructure-plan-v1.md) already existed (369-line complex plan)
2. **Natural Language Parsing**: Claude parsed my input and identified 2 review perspectives + thinking budget
3. **Parallel Processing**: Claude spawned 2 concurrent subtasks:
   - **Comprehensive Review** ‚Üí Found major issues, scored 2/5, recommended 90% scope reduction
   - **Simplicity Review** ‚Üí Identified over-engineering, suggested incremental approach
4. **Synthesis & Revision**: Claude combined both reviews and generated a revised plan
5. **Complete Cycle**: Plan ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Revise ‚Üí Improved plan (simplified from 9 weeks to 2 weeks)

### What It Generated
- **Comprehensive Review**: [`logging-infrastructure-plan-v1-comprehensive-review.md`](plan-reviews/logging-infrastructure-plan-v1-comprehensive-review.md)
- **Simplicity Review**: [`logging-infrastructure-plan-v1-simplicity-review.md`](plan-reviews/logging-infrastructure-plan-v1-simplicity-review.md)
- **Revised Plan**: [`logging-infrastructure-plan-v1-revised.md`](plan-reviews/logging-infrastructure-plan-v1-revised.md)

## Documentation

- **[Complete Power User Guide](docs/slash-commands-for-power-users.md)** - Comprehensive guide from basic commands to advanced AI workflows
- **[Slash Commands Index](docs/slash_commands/)** - Directory of implemented slash commands

## Current Features

### Plan-Review-Revise Workflow
Intelligent multi-perspective analysis of software development plans with automated review and revision.

- **üìñ Detailed Guide**: [Plan-Review-Revise Workflow Guide](docs/slash_commands/plan-review-revise-workflow-guide.md) - Complete usage instructions
- **‚ö° Command**: `/plan_review_revise` (implemented) - See example above!
- **üîç Review Types**: Comprehensive, Simplicity (other types planned)
- **üéØ Example Outputs**: See the [plan-reviews/](plan-reviews/) directory for real generated reviews

### Directory Structure
- `docs/` - User guides and command documentation
- `docs/claude-code-system-instructions/` - Claude Code's self-reported capability documentation
- `plans/` - Example implementation plans for review
- `plan-reviews/` - Generated review outputs and revisions
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash command implementations
- `.claude/prompts/` - Review perspective prompts

### Claude Code System Instructions
The `docs/claude-code-system-instructions/` directory contains detailed documentation about Claude Code's capabilities, obtained by asking Claude Code instances to explain how they work. These documents include:

- **CLAUDE.md system** - How Claude Code works with persistent instruction files
- **# memory syntax** - How to use `#` to add persistent memories  
- **Slash commands** - How to create and use parameterized command workflows

Each document includes reproduction prompts so you can verify or update the information yourself. This is not official Anthropic documentation, but rather Claude Code's self-reported understanding of its own capabilities.

## üéØ Get Started

1. **Clone this repo** into your Claude Code project
2. **Copy the slash commands** from `.claude/commands/` to your own `.claude/commands/` directory
3. **Try the example**: Run `/plan_review_revise` on your own implementation plans
4. **Customize**: Modify the prompts in `.claude/prompts/` for your specific needs

## üôè Credits & Inspiration

Huge thanks to **[IndyDevDan](https://www.youtube.com/@indydevdan)** and the **[just-prompt](https://github.com/disler/just-prompt)** project for being a major inspiration for this work. While the implementations here are original (particularly the named-keyword syntax and natural language parsing in slash commands), the foundational ideas and approach were heavily influenced by Dan's excellent work on AI-powered development workflows.
