## 1. Overview & Project Setup

### What are Claude Code Slash Commands?

Claude Code slash commands are reusable prompts that accept dynamic inputs, enabling you to create custom AI workflows for your development process.

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Create command directory in your project root
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Verify structure
ls -la .claude/commands
```

### Core Concepts

- **Commands**: Markdown files in `.claude/commands/`
- **Parameters**: Variables injected into commands using `$VARIABLE` syntax
- **Invocation**: Execute with `/command_name` followed by parameters

---

## 2. Basic Single Argument Commands

**Best for**: Simple prompts with one dynamic input

### Step 1: Create Your First Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/explain_code.md`

```markdown
Analyze and explain the following code:

$ARGUMENTS

Provide:
1. What the code does
2. Key patterns or algorithms used
3. Potential improvements
4. Any security concerns
```

### Step 2: Test the Command

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Use the command
/explain_code "
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
"
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Parameter Substitution**: Confirm `$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with your input
2. **Output Quality**: Verify Claude provides the expected analysis
3. **Reusability**: Test with different code snippets

### Best Practices

- Keep commands focused on single tasks
- Use descriptive command names
- Test with various input types
- Document expected input format

---

## 3. Named Arguments Commands

**Best for**: Multiple specific parameters with clear roles

### Step 1: Create Named Parameter Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/code_review.md`

```markdown
Perform a code review for the specified component.

## File Analysis
**Primary File**: $MAIN_FILE
**Related Files**: $RELATED_FILES
**Focus Area**: $FOCUS_AREA

## Review Criteria
- Code quality and maintainability
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Best practices adherence

## Specific Focus
Pay special attention to: $FOCUS_AREA

Provide actionable feedback and prioritized recommendations.
```

### Step 2: Invoke with Named Parameters

```bash
/code_review MAIN_FILE=src/auth.js RELATED_FILES="src/utils.js,src/config.js" FOCUS_AREA="authentication security"
```

### Verification Steps

1. **All Parameters**: Confirm each `$PARAMETER` is correctly substituted
2. **Parameter Order**: Verify order doesn't matter
3. **Missing Parameters**: Test behavior with missing parameters

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive parameter names (`$MAIN_FILE` not `$FILE1`)
- Group related parameters logically
- Document parameter expectations
- Test all parameter combinations

---

## 4. Advanced Named Arguments Features

**Best for**: Flexible commands with optional parameters and defaults

### Step 1: Create Advanced Command with Defaults

**File**: `.claude/commands/analyze_performance.md`

```markdown
Analyze performance characteristics of the codebase.

## Target Analysis
**Primary File**: $MAIN_FILE
**Test File**: ${TEST_FILE:-"(auto-detect)"}
**Config**: ${CONFIG_FILE:-"package.json"}

## Analysis Scope
**Performance Metric**: ${METRIC:-"execution time"}
**Optimization Goal**: ${GOAL:-"general performance"}
**Profiling Tool**: ${TOOL:-"built-in"}

## Analysis Tasks
1. Identify performance bottlenecks in $MAIN_FILE
2. Review test coverage in ${TEST_FILE:-"related test files"}
3. Check configuration in ${CONFIG_FILE:-"package.json"}
4. Focus on optimizing: ${METRIC:-"execution time"}
5. Target improvement: ${GOAL:-"general performance"}

Generate actionable performance optimization recommendations.
```

### Step 2: Test Multiple Invocation Patterns

```bash
# Minimal parameters (uses defaults)
/analyze_performance MAIN_FILE=src/api.js

# Partial parameters
/analyze_performance MAIN_FILE=src/api.js METRIC="memory usage" GOAL="reduce memory footprint"

# Full parameters
/analyze_performance MAIN_FILE=src/api.js TEST_FILE=tests/api.test.js CONFIG_FILE=jest.config.js METRIC="bundle size" GOAL="reduce build size" TOOL="webpack-bundle-analyzer"
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Default Values**: Confirm defaults appear when parameters omitted
2. **Override Defaults**: Verify provided values override defaults
3. **Mixed Usage**: Test combinations of provided and default parameters

### Best Practices

- Provide sensible defaults for optional parameters
- Use `${PARAM:-default}` syntax for fallbacks
- Document which parameters are optional
- Design commands to work with minimal input

---

## 5. Self-Parsing Natural Language Commands

> NOTE: See `./docs/slash_commands/plan-review-revise-workflow-guide.md` for a tested example of a self-parsing slash command.

**Best for**: Voice-driven workflows and conversational interfaces

### Step 1: Create Self-Parsing Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/smart_debug.md`

```markdown
---
CLAUDE_PARSING_HINTS:
  TARGET_FILE:
    type: "file_path"
    extensions: [".js", ".ts", ".py", ".java", ".go", ".rs"]
    keywords: ["file", "component", "module", "script"]
    search_paths: ["src/", "lib/", "app/", "components/"]
    description: "File containing the bug or issue"
    ambiguity_handling:
      tolerance: "low"
      strategy: "ask_user"
      auto_select: false
      
  ERROR_TYPE:
    type: "string"
    keywords: ["error", "bug", "issue", "problem", "exception"]
    examples: ["runtime error", "logic bug", "performance issue", "memory leak"]
    description: "Type of error or issue to debug"
    ambiguity_handling:
      tolerance: "medium"
      strategy: "extract_context"
      auto_select: true
      fallback: "general debugging"
      
  URGENCY:
    type: "string"
    keywords: ["urgent", "critical", "high priority", "blocking", "low priority"]
    examples: ["critical", "high", "medium", "low"]
    description: "Priority level of the issue"
    ambiguity_handling:
      tolerance: "high"
      strategy: "extract_context"
      auto_select: true
      fallback: "medium"
---

Debug the issue in the codebase with systematic analysis.

## Target Analysis
**File**: $TARGET_FILE
**Error Type**: $ERROR_TYPE
**Priority**: $URGENCY

## Debugging Process
1. Analyze the code structure and logic flow
2. Identify potential root causes for: $ERROR_TYPE
3. Check common patterns for this type of issue
4. Suggest debugging steps and tools
5. Provide fix recommendations with priority: $URGENCY

Focus on actionable solutions and prevention strategies.
```

### Step 2: Test Natural Language Invocation

```bash
# Natural language input
/smart_debug "There's a memory leak in the user authentication component, it's blocking production deployment"

# Another example
/smart_debug "The API response handler has a runtime error, not urgent but needs fixing"

# Minimal input
/smart_debug "Bug in auth.js"
```

### Expected Claude Responses for Ambiguity

**Multiple file matches:**
```
I found multiple authentication-related files:
1. src/auth/authentication.js
2. src/components/UserAuth.js  
3. src/utils/auth-helpers.js

Which should be the TARGET_FILE for debugging?
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Entity Extraction**: Confirm Claude correctly identifies files, error types, urgency
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Test file name variations ("auth component" → "authentication.js")
3. **Ambiguity Handling**: Verify Claude asks for clarification when multiple matches exist
4. **Fallbacks**: Check that missing parameters use appropriate defaults

### Best Practices

- Design keywords that match natural speech patterns
- Set appropriate tolerance levels per parameter type
- Provide clear examples in the metadata
- Test with voice transcription variations

# Adaptive Problem Solving with Dynamic Thinking

Analyze and solve: $PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION

## Complexity Assessment and Thinking Allocation

AUTO-THINKING WORKFLOW:
1. **Problem Analysis**: Parse description for complexity indicators
2. **Codebase Context**: Scan related files to understand scope
3. **Thinking Budget**: Apply $COMPLEXITY_LEVEL → $THINKING_LEVEL
4. **Domain Focus**: Tailor approach for $DOMAIN_EXPERTISE

## Adaptive Execution Strategy

**For Simple Problems** (think):
- Direct implementation with minimal planning
- Single-pass solution with verification

**For Moderate Problems** (think hard):
- Brief planning phase with alternative consideration
- Implementation with testing and refinement

**For Complex Problems** (think harder):
- Comprehensive analysis of requirements and constraints
- Multiple solution approaches with trade-off analysis
- Iterative implementation with continuous validation

**For Architectural Problems** (ultrathink):
- Deep system analysis and impact assessment
- Multiple stakeholder consideration
- Phased implementation strategy with rollback plans
- Long-term maintainability and scalability analysis

## Self-Monitoring and Escalation

If initial solution appears insufficient:
1. **Auto-escalate** thinking level (simple → moderate → complex → architectural)
2. **Spawn specialist agents** for domain-specific analysis
3. **Request human guidance** for ambiguous requirements
4. **Generate decision documentation** for complex choices

Execute adaptive problem-solving with automatic thinking calibration.
```

### Invocation Examples

```bash
# Simple problem - auto-detects "think" level
/adaptive_solve "Fix the typo in the login button text"

# Complex problem - auto-detects "think harder" level  
/adaptive_solve "Implement a distributed caching layer for our microservices that handles cache invalidation across regions"

# Domain-specific architectural problem
/adaptive_solve "Design a real-time collaborative editing system that can handle 10,000+ concurrent users with conflict resolution"
```

# Collaborative Development Orchestrator with Multi-Instance Coordination

Implement: $FEATURE_SPEC using $COLLABORATION_PATTERN with $TEAM_SIZE agents

## Multi-Instance Workflow Setup

**Phase 1: Environment Preparation**
1. **CREATE** isolated development environments:
   ```bash
   # Set up git worktrees for parallel development
   git worktree add ../feature-primary main
   git worktree add ../feature-review main  
   git worktree add ../feature-testing main
   git worktree add ../feature-docs main
   git worktree add ../feature-integration main
   ```

2. **ESTABLISH** shared communication protocol:
   ```bash
   # Create shared artifact directory
   mkdir -p .collaboration/{tasks,progress,artifacts,communication}
   
   # Initialize coordination files
   echo "[]" > .collaboration/tasks/task_queue.json
   echo "{}" > .collaboration/progress/agent_status.json
   echo "[]" > .collaboration/communication/messages.json
   ```

**Phase 2: Specialized Agent Deployment**
3. **SPAWN** specialist agents with distinct roles:

   **Primary Implementation Agent** (../feature-primary):
   ```markdown
   Role: Core feature implementation
   Responsibilities:
     - Main business logic implementation
     - API design and core functionality
     - Database schema and data layer

     addTask: (agent, task, dependencies = []) => {
       // Add task to shared queue with dependencies
     },
     completeTask: (agent, taskId, artifacts = []) => {
       // Mark task complete and notify dependent agents
     },
     requestReview: (agent, component, reviewType) => {
       // Request specific review from review agent
     },
     resolveConflict: (agents, conflictDescription) => {
       // Initiate consensus-building process
     }
   };
   ```

**Phase 4: Conflict Resolution and Consensus Building**
5. **RESOLVE** conflicts through structured consensus:
   - Detect conflicting implementations or recommendations
   - Gather input from all relevant agents
   - Apply decision-making criteria (performance, maintainability, security)
   - Document decisions and rationale
   - Update shared understanding and artifacts

**Phase 5: Integration and Synthesis**
6. **MERGE** results with comprehensive validation:
   ```bash

   git merge feature-docs/main
   
   # Run comprehensive integration tests
   npm run test:integration
   npm run test:e2e
   npm run test:performance
   
   # Generate final integration report
   claude -p "Generate integration report for completed feature" \
     --allowedTools "Read,Bash(git:*)" > integration_report.md
   ```

**Phase 6: Cleanup and Knowledge Transfer**
7. **CLEANUP** worktrees and capture learnings:
   ```bash
   # Archive collaboration artifacts
   tar -czf feature_collaboration_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz .collaboration/
   
   # Update team knowledge base
   cp .collaboration/artifacts/* docs/team_knowledge/
   
   # Clean up worktrees
   git worktree remove ../feature-primary
   git worktree remove ../feature-review
   git worktree remove ../feature-testing
   git worktree remove ../feature-docs
   git worktree remove ../feature-integration
   ```

## Collaboration Patterns

**Writer-Reviewer Pattern**:
- One agent implements, another reviews continuously
- Real-time feedback and iterative improvement
- Reduced context switching and improved quality

**Specialist-Roles Pattern**:
- Agents with distinct expertise areas
- Parallel work on different aspects

# Semantic Consistency Analyzer with Multi-Agent Intelligence

Analyze comment-code consistency in: $TARGET_SCOPE

**Configuration**: $CONSISTENCY_THRESHOLD threshold, auto-fix at $AUTO_FIX_CONFIDENCE confidence
**Depth**: $ANALYSIS_DEPTH analysis focusing on $FOCUS_AREAS

## Multi-Agent Semantic Analysis Workflow

**Phase 1: Intelligent Code Parsing and Agent Deployment**

1. **SPAWN** specialized semantic analysis agents in parallel:

   **Code Logic Inference Agent**:
   ```markdown
   Role: Deep code behavior understanding
   
   Responsibilities:
     - Parse code into semantic blocks (functions, classes, modules)
     - Infer actual behavior, side effects, and data flow
     - Identify input/output patterns and transformations
     - Map control flow and exception handling
     - Extract performance and complexity characteristics
   
   Advanced Capabilities:
     - Static analysis integration (AST, CFG, dependency graphs)
     - Dynamic behavior inference from patterns
     - Cross-reference analysis with related functions
     - Performance hotspot identification
   ```

   **Natural Language Understanding Agent**:
   ```markdown
   Role: Comment and documentation semantic extraction
   
   Responsibilities:
     - Parse comments, docstrings, and inline documentation
     - Extract stated intent, purpose, and behavioral descriptions
     - Identify temporal references (TODO, FIXME, outdated info)
     - Map natural language to code concepts
     - Detect ambiguous or unclear documentation
   
   Advanced Capabilities:
     - Contextual language understanding
     - Technical domain knowledge application
     - Intent disambiguation through codebase context
     - Comment quality and clarity assessment
   ```

   **Semantic Consistency Validator Agent**:
   ```markdown
   Role: Cross-modal consistency evaluation
   
   Responsibilities:
     - Compare code behavior with documented intent
     - Calculate semantic similarity scores
     - Identify specific inconsistency types and severity
     - Generate confidence scores for findings
     - Prioritize inconsistencies by impact and risk
   
   Consistency Analysis Types:
     - Behavioral mismatch: Code does X, comment says Y
     - Temporal inconsistency: Outdated comments after code changes
     - Scope mismatch: Comment describes wrong granularity
     - Completeness gaps: Missing documentation for complex logic
   ```

**Phase 2: Adaptive Thinking and Deep Analysis**

2. **APPLY** thinking level based on detected complexity:
   ```javascript
   const ConsistencyAnalyzer = {
     analyzeComplexity: (codeBlock, commentBlock) => {
       const codeComplexity = calculateCyclomaticComplexity(codeBlock);
       const commentAmbiguity = assessCommentAmbiguity(commentBlock);
       const domainSpecificity = identifyDomainConcepts(codeBlock);
       
       if (codeComplexity > 15 || commentAmbiguity > 0.7 || domainSpecificity.isHigh) {
         return "exhaustive"; // ultrathink
       } else if (codeComplexity > 8 || commentAmbiguity > 0.5) {
         return "deep"; // think harder
       } else if (codeComplexity > 3 || commentAmbiguity > 0.3) {
         return "moderate"; // think hard
       } else {
         return "surface"; // think
       }
     }
   };
   ```

**Phase 3: Coordinated Consistency Detection**

3. **COORDINATE** agent findings for comprehensive analysis:
   ```markdown
   Consistency Evaluation Process:
   
   1. **Semantic Mapping**: Map code operations to comment statements
   2. **Behavioral Verification**: Verify documented behavior matches implementation
   3. **Intent Alignment**: Assess whether code fulfills stated purpose
   4. **Temporal Consistency**: Check if comments reflect current code state
   5. **Completeness Analysis**: Identify missing or incomplete documentation
   
   Confidence Calculation:
   - Code analysis confidence × Comment understanding confidence × Consistency algorithm confidence
   - Adjusted for domain complexity and ambiguity factors
   - Validated against similar patterns in codebase
   ```

**Phase 4: Intelligent Auto-Correction with Safety**

4. **IMPLEMENT** confidence-based auto-correction:
   ```python
   def auto_fix_consistency_issues(findings, auto_fix_threshold):
       for finding in findings:
           if finding.type == "OUTDATED_COMMENT":
               if finding.confidence > auto_fix_threshold:
                   new_comment = generate_accurate_comment(finding.code_logic)
                   
                   # Safety checks before auto-application
                   if (passes_safety_checks(finding, new_comment) and
                       maintains_comment_style(finding.original_comment, new_comment) and
                       preserves_important_context(finding.original_comment, new_comment)):
                       
                       apply_comment_update(finding.location, new_comment)
                       log_auto_fix("Updated outdated comment", finding.file, finding.line)
                   else:
                       propose_manual_review("Auto-fix blocked by safety checks", finding)
               else:
                   propose_change("Update comment?", finding.file, finding.line, 
                                  f"Confidence: {finding.confidence:.2f}")
           
           elif finding.type == "CODE_COMMENT_MISMATCH":
               # Higher bar for code changes - always require human approval
               propose_investigation("Code-comment mismatch detected", finding.file, finding.line,
                                     f"Comment says: {finding.comment_intent}\n"
                                     f"Code does: {finding.code_behavior}")
   ```

**Phase 5: Learning and Pattern Recognition**

5. **LEARN** from corrections and build team-specific understanding:
   ```markdown
   Continuous Learning System:
   
   - **Pattern Recognition**: Learn common inconsistency patterns in codebase
   - **Style Adaptation**: Adapt to team's comment style and preferences
   - **Domain Learning**: Build understanding of project-specific concepts
   - **Confidence Calibration**: Adjust confidence thresholds based on accuracy
   - **False Positive Reduction**: Learn from rejected suggestions
   
   Team Knowledge Integration:
   - Update CLAUDE.md with discovered comment patterns
   - Create project-specific consistency rules
   - Build glossary of domain-specific terms
   - Document team preferences for comment style
   ```

## Output Artifacts and Integration

**Consistency Analysis Report**:
```markdown
# Semantic Consistency Analysis Report

## Summary
- Files analyzed: 47
- Inconsistencies found: 23
- Auto-fixed: 8 (high confidence)
- Requiring review: 15
- Average consistency score: 0.82

## High-Priority Issues
1. **Critical Mismatch** (src/auth.js:45)
   - Comment: "Validates user credentials"
   - Code: Actually creates new user session
   - Recommendation: Update comment or investigate code intent

2. **Outdated Documentation** (src/api.js:123)
   - Comment: References deprecated OAuth 1.0
   - Code: Implements OAuth 2.0
   - Auto-fix available: Update to current implementation

## Learning Insights
- Pattern detected: Complex async functions often lack adequate documentation
- Team preference: Prefers implementation details in comments
- Domain concepts: Authentication flow terminology standardized
```

**Integration with Development Workflow**:
```bash
# Git pre-commit hook integration
/semantic_consistency_analyzer src/ 0.8 0.95 moderate

# CI/CD pipeline integration  
/semantic_consistency_analyzer --report-only --fail-on-critical

# Watch mode for continuous consistency
/semantic_consistency_analyzer --watch src/ --auto-fix-safe
```

Execute semantic consistency analysis with coordinated multi-agent intelligence.
```

### Invocation Examples

```bash

           }
       
       def apply_risk_tolerance_filter(self, fixes, risk_tolerance):
           thresholds = {
               'ultra-safe': 0.98,
               'conservative': 0.95,
               'balanced': 0.90,
               'aggressive': 0.85
           }
           
           threshold = thresholds.get(risk_tolerance, 0.95)
           return [fix for fix in fixes if fix.safety_score >= threshold]
   ```

**Phase 3: Coordinated Test-Driven Validation**

3. **INTEGRATE** comprehensive testing validation:
   ```markdown
   Test Integration Workflow:
   
   Pre-Fix Test Generation:
     - Generate targeted test cases for the bug scenario
     - Create regression tests to verify fix effectiveness
     - Develop edge case tests for related functionality
     - Generate performance benchmarks if applicable
   
   Fix Application with Testing:
     - Apply proposed fix to isolated environment (git worktree)
     - Run generated tests to verify bug fix
     - Execute full test suite to check for regressions
     - Perform targeted integration tests
     - Run performance benchmarks for performance fixes
   
   Post-Fix Validation:
     - Verify fix addresses original bug scenario
     - Confirm no new issues introduced
     - Validate performance impact is positive/neutral
     - Check code quality metrics are maintained/improved
   ```

**Phase 4: Intelligent Auto-Fix Application with Monitoring**

4. **EXECUTE** safe auto-fixing with comprehensive monitoring:
   ```bash
   # Intelligent auto-fix workflow
   function apply_intelligent_auto_fix() {
       local bug_finding=$1
       local proposed_fix=$2
       local safety_assessment=$3
       
       if [[ ${safety_assessment.safety_score} > $AUTO_FIX_CONFIDENCE ]]; then
           # Create isolated environment for testing
           git worktree add ../fix-testing-${bug_finding.id} HEAD
           cd ../fix-testing-${bug_finding.id}
           
           # Apply fix
           apply_code_changes "$proposed_fix"
           
           # Comprehensive testing
           if run_targeted_tests "$bug_finding" && run_regression_tests; then
               # Fix validated - apply to main codebase
               cd ../main
               apply_code_changes "$proposed_fix"
               
               # Generate commit with detailed information
               git add -A
               git commit -m "🤖 Auto-fix: ${bug_finding.description}
               
               Bug Type: ${bug_finding.category}
               Confidence: ${safety_assessment.safety_score}
               Tests: All passed
               Impact: ${safety_assessment.impact_summary}
               
               Generated by: Claude Code Intelligent Bug Hunter"
               
               log_auto_fix_success "$bug_finding" "$proposed_fix"
           else
               log_auto_fix_failure "$bug_finding" "Failed test validation"
               propose_manual_review "$bug_finding" "$proposed_fix"
           fi
           
           # Cleanup
           cd ../main
           git worktree remove ../fix-testing-${bug_finding.id}
       else
           propose_manual_review "$bug_finding" "$proposed_fix" "$safety_assessment"
       fi
   }
   ```

**Phase 5: Continuous Learning and Pattern Recognition**

5. **LEARN** from fix outcomes and build intelligence:
   ```javascript
   const BugHunterLearningSystem = {
       recordFixOutcome: (bugFinding, proposedFix, outcome) => {
           // Track fix success/failure rates by pattern
           // Adjust confidence calculations based on outcomes
           // Learn team-specific coding patterns and preferences
           // Build project-specific bug pattern database
       },
       
       improveBugDetection: (historicalData) => {
           // Refine detection algorithms based on false positives/negatives
           // Update confidence calculation models
           // Learn new bug patterns from team's codebase
           // Adapt to project-specific frameworks and libraries
       },
       
       updateSafetyThresholds: (teamFeedback, projectCriticality) => {
           // Adjust risk tolerance based on team comfort level
           // Calibrate confidence thresholds for project criticality
           // Learn from manual review decisions
           // Evolve safety assessment criteria
       }
   };
   ```

   ```python
   class RefactoringStrategySynthesizer:
       def generate_refactoring_plan(self, code_analysis, goals, safety_level):
           opportunities = self.identify_opportunities(code_analysis)
           prioritized_opportunities = self.prioritize_by_goals(opportunities, goals)
           safe_refactorings = self.filter_by_safety(prioritized_opportunities, safety_level)
           
           return {
               'high_impact_low_risk': self.get_quick_wins(safe_refactorings),
               'strategic_improvements': self.get_strategic_refactorings(safe_refactorings),
               'architectural_changes': self.get_architectural_refactorings(safe_refactorings),
               'execution_order': self.determine_execution_order(safe_refactorings),
               'risk_assessment': self.assess_cumulative_risk(safe_refactorings)
           }
       
       def prioritize_by_goals(self, opportunities, goals):
           priority_weights = {
               'maintainability': {'extract_method': 0.9, 'reduce_complexity': 0.8},
               'performance': {'optimize_algorithm': 0.9, 'improve_caching': 0.8},
               'readability': {'rename_variable': 0.7, 'extract_variable': 0.6},
               'testability': {'dependency_injection': 0.9, 'extract_interface': 0.8}
           }
           
           for opportunity in opportunities:
               opportunity.priority_score = sum(
                   priority_weights.get(goal, {}).get(opportunity.type, 0.0)
                   for goal in goals
               )
           
           return sorted(opportunities, key=lambda x: x.priority_score, reverse=True)

   function execute_intelligent_refactoring() {
       local refactoring_plan=$1
       local safety_level=$2
       local auto_apply_threshold=$3
       
       # Create isolated refactoring environment
       git worktree add ../refactoring-workspace HEAD
       cd ../refactoring-workspace
       
       for refactoring in "${refactoring_plan.execution_order[@]}"; do
           echo "🔄 Applying refactoring: ${refactoring.description}"
           
           # Create checkpoint
           git checkout -b "checkpoint-${refactoring.id}"
           
           # Apply refactoring transformation
           apply_refactoring_transformation "$refactoring"
           
           # Validate behavior preservation
           if validate_behavior_preservation "$refactoring" "$safety_level"; then
               echo "✅ Behavior preservation validated"
               
               # Check confidence for auto-application
               if [[ ${refactoring.confidence} > $auto_apply_threshold ]]; then
                   git add -A
                   git commit -m "♻️ Refactor: ${refactoring.description}

                   Safety Level: $safety_level
                   
                   Generated by: Claude Code Refactoring Intelligence"
                   
                   log_refactoring_success "$refactoring"
               else
                   propose_refactoring_review "$refactoring"
               fi
           else
               echo "❌ Behavior preservation failed - rolling back"
               git checkout HEAD~1
               log_refactoring_failure "$refactoring" "Behavior preservation violation"
           fi
       done
       
       # Merge successful refactorings back to main
       cd ../main
       if [[ $(git -C ../refactoring-workspace log --oneline | wc -l) > 1 ]]; then
           git merge ../refactoring-workspace/main --no-ff -m "♻️ Merge intelligent refactoring improvements"
       fi
       
       # Cleanup
       git worktree remove ../refactoring-workspace
   }
   ```

**Phase 5: Continuous Learning and Pattern Evolution**

5. **EVOLVE** refactoring intelligence through learning:
   ```javascript
   const RefactoringIntelligenceLearner = {
       learnFromRefactoringOutcomes: (refactorings, outcomes, teamFeedback) => {
           // Track which refactoring patterns are most successful
           // Learn team preferences for code style and structure
           // Adjust confidence calculations based on success rates
           // Identify project-specific refactoring opportunities
       },
       
       evolveRefactoringStrategies: (codebaseAnalysis, historicalData) => {
           // Develop custom refactoring patterns for project domains
           // Learn optimal refactoring sequences for complex changes
           // Adapt to project-specific architectural patterns
           // Improve risk assessment based on project characteristics
       },
       
       updateQualityMetrics: (codeQualityTrends, refactoringImpacts) => {
           // Calibrate quality improvement predictions
           // Learn which metrics matter most for the team
           // Adapt refactoring prioritization based on actual impact
           // Refine behavior preservation validation criteria
       }
   };
   ```

Execute advanced refactoring intelligence with behavior-preserving orchestration.

Execute integrated development intelligence: $INTELLIGENCE_SCOPE

**Configuration**: $AUTOMATION_LEVEL with $WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION workflows

## Master Orchestration Workflow

**Phase 1: Coordinated Multi-Workflow Deployment**

1. **SPAWN** integrated workflow agents in optimal sequence:
   ```bash
   # Parallel execution of complementary workflows
   (
     /semantic_consistency_analyzer src/ 0.8 0.9 moderate &
     /living_docs_orchestrator "comprehensive" "balanced" 0.85 &

   ```

**Phase 3: Intelligent Priority Management**

3. **PRIORITIZE** improvements using cross-workflow intelligence:
   ```markdown
   Integrated Priority Matrix:
   
   Critical Priority (Address Immediately):
   - Security vulnerabilities with comment inconsistencies
   - Bug-prone code with poor documentation
   - Performance bottlenecks in poorly structured code
   
   High Priority (Address This Sprint):
   - Logic errors with refactoring opportunities
   - Documentation gaps in complex refactored code
   - Comment inconsistencies in recently changed code
   
   Medium Priority (Address Next Sprint):
   - Isolated refactoring opportunities
   - Documentation improvements for stable code
   - Minor comment-code inconsistencies
   
   Low Priority (Technical Debt Backlog):
   - Style improvements in well-tested code
   - Documentation enhancements for internal utilities
   - Non-critical refactoring in stable modules
   ```

Execute integrated development intelligence orchestration.

## 22. Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues

**Q: Parameters not substituting correctly**
```bash
# ❌ Wrong: Missing quotes for multi-word values
/command PARAM=hello world

# ✅ Correct: Quoted multi-word values  
/command PARAM="hello world"
```

**Q: Command not found**
```bash
# Verify command file exists
ls .claude/commands/your_command.md

# Check file permissions
chmod 644 .claude/commands/your_command.md
```

**Q: Self-parsing not working**
```bash
# Ensure YAML metadata is properly formatted
# Check for indentation errors in CLAUDE_PARSING_HINTS
```

**Q: High-value workflows not auto-fixing**
```bash
# Check confidence thresholds
/semantic_consistency_analyzer src/ 0.8 0.95 moderate  # Higher auto-fix threshold

# Verify test integration
/intelligent_bug_hunter "comprehensive" "conservative" 0.95 "required"  # Ensure tests pass
```

**Q: Multi-agent coordination failing**
```bash
# Verify git worktree support
git worktree list

# Check shared artifact directories
ls -la .collaboration/

# Ensure proper agent communication
cat .collaboration/progress/agent_status.json
```

### Debug Strategies

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic commands, add complexity gradually
2. **Test Incrementally**: Verify each parameter works individually
3. **Check Syntax**: Validate YAML metadata formatting
4. **Use Verbose Mode**: Add debug output to commands during development
5. **Monitor Confidence**: Watch confidence scores in high-value workflows
6. **Validate Safety**: Ensure safety mechanisms are working in auto-fixing workflows

### Performance Tips

- **Cache Results**: For expensive operations, consider caching strategies
- **Parallel Execution**: Use multiple agents for independent tasks
- **Resource Management**: Monitor tool usage and optimize accordingly
- **Confidence Tuning**: Adjust confidence thresholds based on team needs
- **Workflow Integration**: Combine complementary workflows for efficiency
