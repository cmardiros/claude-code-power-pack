# Tool Permission Assessment - January 6, 2025

## Tool Safety Assessment

### Read-Only Tools (Safe for Persistent Access)
- **Glob** - File pattern matching only, cannot modify files or system state
- **Grep** - Content search using regex, read-only file scanning
- **LS** - Directory listing only, no file modification capabilities
- **Read** - File reading only, including images and various file formats
- **NotebookRead** - Jupyter notebook reading only, no execution or modification
- **WebFetch** - Web content fetching and analysis, no system modifications
- **WebSearch** - Web searching only, no local system access
- **TodoRead** - Task list reading only, no modifications
- **mcp__ide__getDiagnostics** - VS Code diagnostics reading only

### Tools with Write Access (Require Caution)
- **Update** - ⚠️ **WRITES** to files, wrapper around edit functionality
- **Edit** - ⚠️ **WRITES** to files using find/replace operations
- **MultiEdit** - ⚠️ **WRITES** multiple edits to single files
- **Write** - ⚠️ **WRITES** new files or overwrites existing files
- **NotebookEdit** - ⚠️ **WRITES** to Jupyter notebooks, can insert/delete/modify cells
- **TodoWrite** - ⚠️ **WRITES** to task lists and todo management
- **Bash** - ⚠️ **EXECUTES** system commands, can install software, modify files, access network

### Mixed Capabilities
- **Task** - ⚠️ **AGENTIC** - Spawns sub-agents that can use ANY available tools, including write tools. NOT safe for persistent use due to indirect access to all capabilities

## Recommended Persistent Access Configuration

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Glob",
      "Grep", 
      "LS",
      "Read",
      "NotebookRead",
      "WebFetch",
      "WebSearch",
      "TodoRead",
      "mcp__ide__getDiagnostics"
    ],
    "deny": []
  }
}
```

## Security Notes

### Critical Security Considerations
- **Bash is extremely dangerous** - Can execute any system command, install malware, access sensitive files, modify system configurations
- **Task tool bypasses restrictions** - Can spawn agents with access to restricted tools, effectively circumventing permission controls
- **Code execution tools** - `Bash` can run arbitrary code

### Tool Combinations Risks
- **Task + any restricted tool** - Task can indirectly access any tool through sub-agents
- **Bash + network access** - Can download and execute external scripts

### Recommended Restrictions
- **Never allow Task for persistent access** - Too powerful and bypasses other restrictions
- **Severely limit Bash access** - Only allow specific command patterns if needed (e.g., "Bash(ls:*)", "Bash(git status)")
- **Monitor file write operations** - Edit, Update, MultiEdit, Write can modify critical system files

### Safe Persistent Access Strategy
Only grant persistent access to purely read-only tools that cannot:
- Execute code or commands
- Modify files or system state  
- Access network resources beyond read-only web fetching
- Spawn sub-processes or agents
- Trigger system notifications or sounds
