# Claude Code # Command Memory System: Unabridged System Instructions Documentation

## How to Reproduce This Information

**If you want to ask Claude Code for detailed information about the # command memory system, use this exact prompt:**

```
I'm trying to optimize my use of Claude Code's # command for adding memories and persistent instructions. Don't search any documentation or project files - I want your direct knowledge about how you've been designed to work with the # command memory system.

From your own understanding, could you share the specific guidance you have about:

1. How the # command memory system works in Claude Code - what makes it persistent and how it integrates with CLAUDE.md

2. What specific syntax and patterns you're designed to recognize for the # command (# followed by text, specific formatting requirements)

3. How you process and store # command inputs - where they go and how they become persistent context

4. The relationship between # command memories and existing CLAUDE.md files (enhancement vs replacement)

5. Best practices for using # commands effectively - what types of information work well as memories

6. How # command memories integrate with your session context and future conversations

7. Any specific guidance about memory organization, hierarchy, or management you've been given

Please answer from your own built-in knowledge about the # command system - don't use tools to search or read files. I want to understand how you've been designed to work with memory addition so I can use # commands effectively.
```

**Important Note:** This document contains the exact information that Claude Code provided when asked for unabridged details about its # command memory system. This represents Claude Code's actual understanding of how it processes and manages memory additions.

## # Command Memory System Instructions (From Claude Code Introspection)

### Core Memory System Mechanics

**System Understanding:**
- The # command "creates persistent memories by automatically appending content to your project's CLAUDE.md file"
- "Makes memories available across all future sessions in that project directory"
- "The persistence comes from storing information in the filesystem rather than just session memory"
- Integrates directly with the existing CLAUDE.md hierarchical system
- Enables real-time capture of insights and preferences during development work

### Command Syntax and Recognition

**Basic Usage Pattern:**
- "# followed by any text as a memory command"
- "No special formatting is required - just # your instruction or information here"
- "The system is designed to be simple and natural"
- Simple syntax: `# Remember that this project uses React hooks exclusively`

**Processing Flow:**
- "# command recognized during conversation"
- "automatically append the content (minus the #) to your CLAUDE.md file"
- "The information becomes part of my persistent context for that project, loaded at the start of every new session"
- Immediate integration into persistent context

### Integration with CLAUDE.md Hierarchy

**File Target Selection:**
- **Project-level memories**: Added to `./CLAUDE.md` for team-shared context
- **User-level memories**: Added to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for personal preferences
- **Context-dependent placement**: System determines appropriate location based on content scope

**Enhancement vs Replacement:**
- "# commands enhance rather than replace existing CLAUDE.md content"
- "New memories are appended to preserve existing project context while adding new information"
- Maintains existing instruction structure and hierarchy
- Preserves manually written CLAUDE.md content

### Memory Content and Persistence

**What Makes Good Memories:**
- "Project-specific preferences and conventions"
- "Custom workflows and processes"
- "Important context about the codebase"
- "Recurring instructions you don't want to repeat"
- "Domain-specific knowledge for the project"

**Persistence Mechanics:**
- Memories "survive beyond the current conversation"
- Become part of the permanent CLAUDE.md instruction set
- Available in all future sessions within the same context
- Integrated into the hierarchical context loading system

### Session Integration and Context Building

**Real-Time Learning:**
- Memories added during active development sessions
- Capture insights as they're discovered
- Build project knowledge incrementally
- Adapt AI behavior based on actual usage patterns

**Context Availability:**
- "# command memories load automatically when I start working in a project directory"
- "They become part of my base context, influencing how I approach tasks throughout the conversation"
- Future conversations automatically include these memories
- No restart or reload required for memory activation
- Seamless integration with existing persistent instructions

### Best Practices for Memory Creation

**Effective Memory Content:**
- **Specific preferences**: "Use TypeScript interfaces over types for this project"
- **Tool configurations**: "Always run `npm run type-check` before commits"
- **Project patterns**: "API responses use camelCase, database uses snake_case"
- **Team conventions**: "Prefer functional components with hooks over class components"
- **Domain knowledge**: "User roles: admin, editor, viewer with specific permissions"

**Memory Scope Considerations:**
- **Project-specific**: Technical decisions, architecture patterns, team preferences
- **Personal**: Individual coding style, preferred shortcuts, personal workflow preferences
- **Universal**: General preferences that apply across all projects

### Memory Organization and Management

**Built-in Organization Assistance:**
- "I'm designed to help organize memories by suggesting logical groupings and helping maintain clarity"
- "Memories should be specific enough to be actionable but general enough to remain relevant over time"
- System automatically maintains readability and structure

**Hierarchical Integration:**
- Memories follow the same priority system as CLAUDE.md files
- Project memories take precedence over user memories for conflicts
- Directory-specific memories override broader project memories
- Maintains existing import and reference patterns

**Content Organization:**
- New memories organized logically within existing CLAUDE.md structure
- Related memories grouped together when possible
- Maintains readability and structure of instruction files
- Can be manually reorganized and refined later

**Simplicity Focus:**
- "The system is built for simplicity - just use # followed by what you want remembered"
- No complex syntax or formatting requirements
- Natural language processing for memory content

### Advanced Memory Patterns

**Incremental Learning:**
- Build project understanding over time through repeated # commands
- Capture evolving team preferences and standards
- Document discovered patterns and anti-patterns
- Create living documentation of project evolution

**Context-Aware Memory Addition:**
- System considers current working directory for memory placement
- Understands project vs personal scope based on content
- Integrates with existing project context and constraints
- Maintains consistency with established patterns

### Team Collaboration Through Memories

**Shared Knowledge Building:**
- Project-level memories become team knowledge
- Capture and share discovered best practices
- Document team decisions and reasoning
- Create consistent AI behavior across team members

**Version Control Integration:**
- # command updates to CLAUDE.md can be committed with regular changes
- Memory evolution tracked through git history
- Team members can review and refine shared memories
- Collaborative improvement of AI instruction quality

## Additional System Guidance for # Command Memory

### Memory Content Guidelines

**High-Value Memory Types:**
- **Decision Documentation**: "Chose Redux over Context API for complex state management"
- **Tool Integration**: "Use Prettier with 2-space indentation and single quotes"
- **Architecture Decisions**: "Services communicate via REST APIs, no direct database access"
- **Domain Rules**: "Price calculations always use BigDecimal to avoid floating point errors"
- **Workflow Preferences**: "Feature branches follow pattern: feature/TICKET-123-description"

**Avoid Low-Value Memories:**
- Generic programming advice that applies to all projects
