# Logging Infrastructure Implementation Plan for Just-Prompt

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive logging infrastructure implementation for the just-prompt MCP server codebase. The plan addresses current basic logging limitations and proposes a robust, production-ready solution that integrates with the existing atomic architecture (atoms, molecules, and server components).

## Background & Motivation

### Current State Analysis

The just-prompt codebase currently implements basic Python logging in several key locations:

- **Server Module (`/src/just_prompt/server.py`)**: Basic logging with `logging.basicConfig()` at lines 28-33
- **Utils Module (`/src/just_prompt/atoms/shared/utils.py`)**: Duplicate logging configuration at lines 11-16  
- **OpenAI Provider (`/src/just_prompt/atoms/llm_providers/openai.py`)**: Provider-specific logging for API calls and reasoning effort levels
- **Prompt Molecule (`/src/just_prompt/molecules/prompt.py`)**: Error logging in parallel processing workflows

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **Inconsistent Log Levels**: Different modules use varying verbosity without centralized control
2. **No Structured Logging**: Plain text logs lack contextual metadata for debugging complex multi-provider scenarios
3. **Missing Request Tracing**: No correlation IDs for tracking requests across the MCP tool pipeline
4. **Security Blind Spots**: API keys and sensitive data may leak into logs without proper sanitization
5. **Performance Impact**: Synchronous logging in high-throughput scenarios (ThreadPoolExecutor usage in `prompt.py`)

### Business Drivers

- **Compliance Requirements**: Enterprise customers need audit trails for LLM interactions
- **Debugging Multi-Provider Issues**: Complex error scenarios across anthropic, openai, gemini, groq, deepseek providers
- **Performance Monitoring**: Understanding bottlenecks in the CEO and Board decision-making workflows
- **Security Auditing**: Tracking authentication events and API key usage patterns

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview

The logging infrastructure will implement a hierarchical logger system aligned with the atomic design:

```
just_prompt (root logger)
├── atoms
│   ├── llm_providers (provider-specific logs)
│   │   ├── openai
│   │   ├── anthropic  
│   │   ├── gemini
│   │   ├── groq
│   │   └── deepseek
│   └── shared (utility logs)
│       ├── auth_middleware
│       ├── auth_service
│       ├── model_router
│       └── validator
├── molecules (business logic logs)
│   ├── prompt
│   ├── ceo_and_board_prompt
│   └── auth_api
└── server (MCP server logs)
```

### Core Components Design

#### 1. Centralized Logger Factory (`atoms/shared/logger_factory.py`)

```python
class LoggerFactory:
    """Centralized logger creation with context injection"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_logger(name: str, correlation_id: str = None) -> StructuredLogger:
        # Implementation with correlation ID injection
        pass
```

#### 2. Structured Log Formatter (`atoms/shared/log_formatter.py`)

Support for multiple output formats:
- JSON for production environments and log aggregation
- Human-readable for development
- Custom MCP-aware format showing tool call flows

#### 3. Async Log Handler (`atoms/shared/async_log_handler.py`)

Non-blocking logging to prevent performance degradation in the ThreadPoolExecutor parallel processing used by `molecules/prompt.py`.

#### 4. Security Sanitizer (`atoms/shared/log_sanitizer.py`)

Automatic detection and redaction of:
- API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.)
- Model response content above configurable size limits
- PII patterns in prompt text

### Integration Points

#### MCP Server Integration (`server.py`)

Modify the existing `call_tool()` method at line 155 to inject correlation IDs:

```python
@server.call_tool()
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[TextContent]:
    correlation_id = generate_correlation_id()
    logger = LoggerFactory.get_logger(__name__, correlation_id)
    logger.info("Tool call initiated", extra={
        "tool_name": name,
        "arguments_hash": hash_sensitive_data(arguments)
    })
```

#### Provider Integration

Enhance existing provider modules (e.g., `atoms/llm_providers/openai.py`) to log:
- API call latency and token usage
- Reasoning effort level usage for o-series models
- Fallback scenarios when Responses API unavailable

#### Authentication Flow Integration

Integrate with the new authentication components (`auth_middleware.py`, `auth_service.py`) to log:
- Authentication attempts and failures
- Token refresh events
- Permission violations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Framework

#### Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive Provider Coverage**: Test all LLM provider logging scenarios including OpenAI reasoning effort levels, Anthropic Claude responses, and Gemini API interactions
2. **Security Validation**: Automated tests for API key sanitization, PII redaction, and sensitive data handling across all provider authentication flows
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking async logging performance against ThreadPoolExecutor parallel processing in `prompt.py`

#### Intentional Weaknesses:
1. **Over-Engineered Mock Scenarios**: Tests create unnecessarily complex mock setups that simulate 50+ different logging scenarios, making test maintenance difficult and obscuring actual business logic
2. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Missing test coverage for network failures during log transmission, log buffer overflow scenarios, and recovery from corrupted log files
3. **Unclear Test Dependencies**: Complex test fixtures with interdependent state that makes it difficult to run tests in isolation or understand failure causes

### Integration Testing

#### Testing Matrix:
```
Provider × Log Level × Output Format × Authentication State
- 5 providers (openai, anthropic, gemini, groq, deepseek)
- 4 log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)  
- 3 output formats (JSON, human-readable, MCP-custom)
- 2 auth states (authenticated, unauthenticated)
= 120 test combinations
```

#### Load Testing
- Simulate CEO and Board workflow with 10+ concurrent board members
- Test log performance under 1000+ parallel prompt requests
- Validate async log handler under memory pressure

### Security Testing

#### Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive Sanitization Testing**: Validate API key redaction across all supported environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
2. **Cross-Provider Security**: Test sensitive data handling in multi-provider scenarios including CEO and Board decision workflows

#### Intentional Weaknesses:
1. **Missing Production Security Scenarios**: No testing for log injection attacks, insufficient validation of user-controlled prompt content, and missing tests for log tampering prevention
2. **Incomplete Compliance Coverage**: Testing doesn't address GDPR right-to-deletion requirements, SOC2 audit trail requirements, or HIPAA logging standards that enterprise customers may require

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Configuration

#### Development Environment
```python
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
LOG_FORMAT=human_readable  
LOG_OUTPUT=console
ASYNC_LOGGING=false
```

#### Production Environment
```python
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FORMAT=json
LOG_OUTPUT=file,syslog
ASYNC_LOGGING=true
LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90
```

### Deployment Pipeline Integration

#### CI/CD Integration
- Automated log format validation in GitHub Actions
- Performance regression testing for logging overhead
- Security scan for sensitive data exposure in logs

#### Monitoring Setup
- Integration with existing MCP server health checks
- Custom metrics for just-prompt specific events
- Dashboard creation for provider performance tracking

### Rollout Strategy

#### Phase 1: Shadow Logging (Week 7)
- Deploy new logging alongside existing basic logging
- Compare output and performance
- Validate in development environments

#### Phase 2: Gradual Migration (Week 8)
- Enable for non-critical components first
- Monitor for performance degradation
- Collect feedback from development team

#### Phase 3: Full Production (Week 9)
- Replace all basic logging configurations
- Enable all advanced features
- Monitor production performance metrics

## Security & Compliance Framework

### Data Classification

#### Sensitive Data Categories:
1. **Authentication Credentials**: API keys, tokens, authentication headers
2. **User Content**: Prompt text, model responses, file content from `prompt_from_file`
3. **System Metadata**: Internal model routing decisions, correction attempts
4. **Performance Data**: Response times, token usage, cost calculations

### Access Control Matrix

| Role | Read Logs | Configure | Export | Archive |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Developer | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| DevOps | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Security | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Audit | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |

### Compliance Gaps & Limitations

#### Intentional Security Weaknesses:
1. **Insufficient Encryption**: Logs stored in plaintext format without encryption at rest, creating potential data exposure risk for enterprise deployments
2. **Missing Audit Trail Integrity**: No cryptographic signing of log entries, making it impossible to detect tampering for compliance scenarios
3. **Inadequate Access Controls**: Basic file-system permissions insufficient for enterprise security requirements, missing integration with centralized identity providers

#### Architectural Limitations:
1. **Over-Complex Configuration**: 47 different configuration parameters make production deployment error-prone and difficult to validate
2. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Single async log handler becomes bottleneck when scaling beyond 100 concurrent MCP connections
3. **Incomplete Observability**: Missing distributed tracing integration makes debugging issues across multiple provider calls difficult

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Logging overhead affecting ThreadPoolExecutor performance in `prompt.py`
- **Mitigation**: Async logging with configurable buffer sizes and backpressure handling

#### Security Exposure  
- **Risk**: API key leakage in structured logs
- **Mitigation**: Multiple sanitization layers and automated security scanning

#### Operational Complexity
- **Risk**: Over-engineered solution difficult to maintain
- **Mitigation**: Phased rollout with feedback loops and simplified configuration options

### Monitoring & Alerting

#### Key Metrics
- Log processing latency (target: <1ms)
- Memory usage growth (alert: >10MB buffer)
- Failed sanitization attempts (alert: any occurrence)
- Async queue depth (alert: >1000 entries)

#### Alert Escalation
1. **Level 1**: Automated recovery attempts
2. **Level 2**: Development team notification  
3. **Level 3**: Incident response activation
4. **Level 4**: Security team involvement
