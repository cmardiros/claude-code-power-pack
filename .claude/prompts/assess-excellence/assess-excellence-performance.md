## Core Philosophy: Intelligent Performance Engineering

<thinking>
Performance excellence isn't about micro-optimizations‚Äîit's about understanding where performance matters, measuring the right things, and making informed trade-offs. Look for evidence that the engineer understands algorithmic complexity, resource constraints, and user experience implications of performance choices.
